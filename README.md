#### Hey ðŸ‘‹

This account was **abandoned** on June 13, 2022, and all the work (except for PR and issues) was transferred to a new account. More precisely, the old one, judging by the date of registration of my already current account. This was done for several reasons:

- Appearance of a new nickname
- I already had an old GitHub account (thanks, old me)
- And curiosity ðŸ™ƒ

I didn't think it was possible to "merge" two accounts until I came across a related article on GitHub Docs. Everything went smoothly, except for the stars... I didn't look for a way to automate this, so I took turns adding all 330+ stars to my new account.

Anyway, you can now find me by this nickname:

### [@Holoniix](https://github.com/Holoniix)
